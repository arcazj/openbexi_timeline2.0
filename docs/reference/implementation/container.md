# Local-Volume Container

The Dockerfile builds the same self-contained client and a Python 3.12 service
using locked npm/uv dependencies. The runtime uses UID/GID 10001, one writer, no
Node runtime and a separate local persistent data volume. Build context is
allowlisted; runtime data, credentials, editor files and browser artifacts are not
sent to the builder. No image is pushed or published by these commands.

```powershell
docker build --target runtime --tag openbexi-timeline:local .
docker volume create openbexi-timeline-data
$env:OPENBEXI_API_TOKEN = uv run python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
docker run --name openbexi-timeline --detach --read-only --tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=128m --cap-drop ALL --security-opt no-new-privileges --publish 127.0.0.1:8765:8765 --mount source=openbexi-timeline-data,target=/var/lib/openbexi --env OPENBEXI_API_TOKEN openbexi-timeline:local
```

Retain that credential privately. On restart the existing JSON identity root is
authoritative; a newly generated environment value does not replace it. Connect
through `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. Readiness is `/health/ready`; process liveness is
`/health/live`. The health check does not certify the entire release.

Do not run two containers against the volume, use multiple workers, put data on a
network share, expose the port publicly without the remaining deployment review,
or mount a workspace containing credentials as static content. Bind-mount operators
must establish UID/GID 10001 permissions themselves; the entry point never runs a
recursive privileged ownership rewrite. Stop the container before inactive-root
backup, migration, restore or identity recovery. Follow [backup/restore](backup-restore.md)
and [identity recovery](identity.md); never remove metadata to bypass failures.

## Linux Verification Target

```powershell
docker build --target verification --tag openbexi-timeline:verification .
docker run --rm openbexi-timeline:verification
docker run --rm openbexi-timeline:verification npm test
docker run --rm openbexi-timeline:verification npm run test:parity
docker run --rm --shm-size=1g openbexi-timeline:verification npm run test:e2e
docker run --rm --init --shm-size=1g openbexi-timeline:verification xvfb-run -a npm run test:matrix
```

The separate target contains test dependencies and Linux Chromium/Firefox.
The Firefox matrix uses Xvfb and Mesa for WebGL2; `--init` lets the virtual-display
launcher receive its startup signals correctly when invoked directly as the
container command. Chromium remains headless. The canvas checks are not skipped.
Temporary fixture roots are not the production volume. Preserve reports by copying
`/app/artifacts` from an explicitly named test container before deleting that
container; `--rm` examples intentionally discard reports. Passing these commands
is evidence for that image only, not a Windows, screen-reader, power-loss or
controlled performance qualification.

Node/Python/uv base images are pinned by resolved multi-platform digest. Capture
the final image ID, lockfile hashes and standalone build manifest for every
candidate; base updates require an explicit digest change and a fresh test run.
uv integration follows its
[official container integration guidance](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/).
No final image, container test or public-release qualification is implied merely
by this Dockerfile's existence.
